### 1. Single-shot recording
- Get the SystemView RTT buffer address and the number of bytes used. `(Normally _SEGGER_RTT.aUp[1].pBuffer and _SEGGER_RTT.aUp[1].WrOff)`
- Take the memory dump to a file
- Save the file with `.SVDat` extension

- Use that file to load in to SystemView software to analyze the events
