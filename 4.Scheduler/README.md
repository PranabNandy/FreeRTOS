# Scheduler 

#### Why do we need Scheduler ?
1. It just a piece of code which implements task switching in and Task switching out according to the scheduling policy selected.
2. The basic job of the scheduler is to determine which is the next potential taskto run on the CPU

#### Scheduling Policies ( Scheduler types )
1. simple Pre-emptive Scheduling (Round robin )
2. Priority based Pre-Emptive Scheduling
3. Co-operative Scheduling

   
- `It creates 2 task`
  + Idle Task
  + Timer Service Task ( Timer Svc)
 

## Idle Task
- It is the lowest priority task which is automatically created when the scheduler is started
- The idle task is responsible for freeing memory allocated by the RTOS to tasks that have been deleted
- When there are no tasks running, the Idle task will always run on the CPU.
- You can give an application hook function in the idle task to send the CPU to low power mode when there are no useful tasks are executing.

- Idle task hook function implements a callback from idle task to your application
- You have to enable the idle task hook function feature by setting this config item configUSE_TICK_HOOK to 1 within FreeRTOSConfig.h
- Then implement the below function in your application
  + **void vApplicationIdleHook( void );**
- Thatâ€™s it , whenever idle task is allowed to run, your hook function will get called, where you can do some useful stuffs like sending the MCU to lower mode to save power
- When the hook function is called, care must be taken that the idle hook function does not call any API functions that could cause it to block

## Timer Services Task (Timer_svc)
- This is also called as timer daemon task
- The timer daemon task deals with **Software timers**
- This task is created automatically when the scheduler is started and if **configUSE_TIMERS =1** in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`
- The RTOS uses this daemon to manage FreeRTOS software timers and nothing else.
- If you don't use software timers in your FreeRTOS application then you need to use this Timer daemon task. For that just make **configUSE_TIMERS = 0** in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`
- All software timer callback functions execute in the context of the timer daemon task

  
### vPortSVCHandler()
- It only used once in the entire program execution
- **PendSV Handler** working as an Scheduler
- **Sys Tick Handler** working as SysTick Timer
